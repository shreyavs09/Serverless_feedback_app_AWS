# Serverless Feedback Collection App

A fully serverless web application for collecting and viewing user feedback using AWS services. This project is designed to operate entirely within the AWS Free Tier and demonstrates the integration of Amazon S3, AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB in a practical use case.

---

## üìå Features

- HTML form to collect user feedback
- Viewer page to display stored feedback entries
- RESTful APIs built with API Gateway
- Scalable, pay-as-you-go architecture
- No server provisioning or infrastructure management required

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- AWS Free Tier account
- IAM user with admin privileges

### 1. Set Up S3 Bucket
- Go to the S3 Console
- Create a bucket named `shreya-feedback-app`
- Enable **Static Website Hosting** under the Properties tab
- Uncheck "Block all public access" under Permissions
- Upload `index.html` and `view-feedback.html`
- Set a bucket policy to make objects publicly readable

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::shreya-feedback-app/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Set Up DynamoDB Table
- Go to DynamoDB Console
- Click **Create Table**
- Table name: `FeedbackTable`
- Partition key: `id` (type: String)
- Leave everything else as default (On-demand capacity mode)

### 3. Create Lambda Functions
#### `submitFeedback`
- Python runtime
- Parses JSON from API
- Saves `id`, `name`, `feedback` to `FeedbackTable`

#### `getFeedback`
- Scans DynamoDB table
- Returns feedback records as JSON

### 4. Assign IAM Roles
- Go to IAM Console
- Find execution roles for each Lambda function
- Attach the `AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess` or `ReadOnlyAccess` as needed

### 5. Create REST API in API Gateway
- Create a new REST API named `feedbackApi`
- Add a resource `/feedback`
- Create two methods under `/feedback`:
  - `POST` method ‚Üí linked to `submitFeedback`
  - `GET` method ‚Üí linked to `getFeedback`
- Enable **CORS** for both methods

### 6. Deploy API Gateway
- Choose **Actions ‚Üí Deploy API**
- Create a new stage: `prod`
- Save the generated Invoke URL

### 7. Integrate API with Frontend
In both HTML files:
- Replace placeholder `apiUrl` in the JavaScript with your actual deployed URL

```javascript
const apiUrl = 'https://your-api-id.execute-api.region.amazonaws.com/prod/feedback';
```

- Re-upload the updated HTML files to your S3 bucket
